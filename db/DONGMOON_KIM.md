## Profile

I have a deep love for coding and enjoy every step of building software, from brainstorming ideas to deploying fully functional applications. My journey in software development has been diverse, spanning front-end magic with ReactJS to tackling complex back-end challenges in C# .NET. I thrive in environments where I can continually learn and apply new technologies, and I'm always ready for the next exciting project. Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring the vibrant city of Copenhagen, indulging in photography, and immersing myself in the world of tech podcasts.
